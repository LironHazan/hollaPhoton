HollaPhoton is a node.js - angular.js based project application in scope of IOT.

HollaPhoton allows a registered particle.io user which holds a photon/core devices to login to his account and view 
registered devices.
It wraps some of the ParticleJS main functions such:
- cloud login
- get list of devices
- get deviceId 

etc..
Beside that it's API is not generic, meaning all REST services currently fit only to my tested devices firmware and fit my specific needs.
It is not a commercial product.
